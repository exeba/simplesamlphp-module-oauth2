This is a working config example, not suitable for production.
It installs simplesamlphp with the oauth2 module and defines a sample application to go through the oauth2 flow.

The docker version (`run-docker.sh`) uses the latest git version of the module,
the local version (`run-local.sh`) uses the local version of the module and is useful for testing and development
